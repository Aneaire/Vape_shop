To design an effective web application for your inventory system, you'll want to create pages that allow users to view, manage, and interact with your data efficiently. Here's a suggestion for the main pages you might want to include:

1. Dashboard
2. Products List
3. Product Detail
4. Categories Management
5. Suppliers Management
6. Brands Management
7. Inventory Overview
8. Reports

Let me break these down for you:

1. Dashboard: 
   - A homepage that gives an overview of key metrics
   - Quick access to other sections
   - Perhaps recent activities or alerts

2. Products List:
   - List all products with key information
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Option to add new products

3. Product Detail:
   - Detailed view of a single product
   - Edit product information
   - View associated inventory levels

4. Categories Management:
   - List all categories
   - Add, edit, or delete categories
   - Associate products with categories

5. Suppliers Management:
   - List all suppliers
   - Add, edit, or delete supplier information
   - View products associated with each supplier

6. Brands Management:
   - List all brands
   - Add, edit, or delete brand information
   - View products associated with each brand

7. Inventory Overview:
   - Current stock levels for all products

8. Reports:
